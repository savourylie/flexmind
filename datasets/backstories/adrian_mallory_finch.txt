## Early Life (1979–1997)
- Born to Henry Finch (a local fisherman) and Margaret Mallory Finch (a watercolour artist).
- Grew up in a small house overlooking Porthmeor Beach; spent most childhood days fishing, beachcombing, or sketching boats.
- At age 9, found a rusted pocket watch buried in sand — claimed it sparked his obsession with maritime history.
- Parents’ marriage strained when father’s boat was damaged in a 1988 storm; father took seasonal work in Spain for several years.
- Margaret began selling her paintings to tourists; Adrian helped by setting up stalls and learned the basics of salesmanship.
- Attended St. Ives Secondary School; excelled in history, geography, and art but was mediocre in mathematics.
- Teen hobbies: Surfing (never competitive), repairing old radios, writing illustrated short stories about fictional sea voyages.
- At 16, won a national essay competition on the history of Cornish shipwrecks; prize was a week aboard a marine research vessel — cemented his future career path.

## University Years & Early Career (1997–2005)
- Accepted into University of Southampton for Marine Archaeology.
- Summer 1998: Worked as a deckhand on a research expedition in the Aegean Sea; learned basic Greek phrases.
- Became known for meticulous underwater mapping sketches — professors encouraged him to merge art with science.
- 2000: Dissertation on “Trade and Cultural Exchange Along the 14th-Century Cornish Coast” earned national recognition.
- Graduated 2001 with First-Class Honours.
- 2002–2005: Worked for the British Maritime Heritage Trust, cataloguing shipwreck sites in the North Atlantic.
- 2003 Incident: While surveying off the coast of Shetland, a sudden storm capsized their inflatable; Finch sustained a head wound but rescued a colleague from hypothermia — received a civilian bravery award.
- Began developing a personal archive of over 3,000 photographs and sketches of shipwreck remains, some unpublished.

## Mid-Career Adventures (2005–2016)
- 2005–2009: Contracted by UNESCO to assist in Southeast Asian maritime heritage projects; spent months in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia.
- Learned conversational Japanese during a 2008 research collaboration with the University of Tokyo.
- 2009: Published “The Silent Harbours: Forgotten Coastal Civilisations,” blending archaeological data with travel memoir — unexpectedly became a bestseller in niche circles.
- 2010–2012: Led a joint British-French survey of medieval trade routes in the Bay of Biscay.
- 2011: Briefly engaged to Dr. Eleanor Shaw, a marine biologist; relationship ended when she accepted a permanent post in New Zealand. They remain on polite terms.
- 2013: Founded the Finch Maritime Archive, a digital repository of shipwreck data open to researchers worldwide.
- 2014: Suffered a severe diving accident (equipment malfunction at 32m depth) — forced to take 9 months off diving. Turned the downtime into writing a second book, “Lighthouses and Longings,” a blend of history and personal reflection.

- Keeps a small weather station on the lighthouse roof and logs daily data in pencil.
- Writes letters (not emails) to a network of 40+ colleagues worldwide — insists on fountain pens and sealing wax.
