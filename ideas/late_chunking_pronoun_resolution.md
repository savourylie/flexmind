# Late Chunking for Pronoun Resolution

**Status**: Research Idea - Potential Publication  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Priority**: Medium-High (Novel application of recent technique)

## Problem Statement

Traditional coreference resolution systems struggle with complex multi-entity scenarios where multiple pronouns refer to different entities in close proximity. Classic example:

> "When Alice met Beth at the café, she told her that she had won the lottery."

Which "she" refers to Alice? Which to Beth? Existing neural coref systems often fail here due to ambiguous syntactic patterns and limited contextual understanding.

## Proposed Solution

Use **late chunking** with long-context embedding models to resolve pronoun coreference through contextual token embeddings.

### Technical Approach

1. **Apply Late Chunking**: Use long-context embedding models (e.g., jina-embeddings-v2-base-en, 8K tokens) to generate contextual token embeddings for entire passages
2. **Extract Contextual Embeddings**: Each pronoun and potential antecedent gets a context-aware embedding that reflects its specific semantic role in the discourse
3. **Similarity-Based Resolution**: Use cosine similarity between pronoun embeddings and entity embeddings to determine coreference relationships
4. **Context-Aware Matching**: Unlike generic embeddings, these are computed with full passage context, so each "she" should embed differently based on its semantic role

### Why This Could Work

- **Rich Context**: Each token embedding incorporates information from the entire passage
- **Semantic Role Awareness**: Pronouns in different semantic roles (agent vs. patient) should embed differently
- **Entity Specificity**: Entity embeddings reflect their discourse role, not just generic name representations
- **Direct Matching**: Simple similarity computation vs. complex span-based neural architectures

## Novelty & Research Value

### What's New
- **First Application**: Late chunking (2023, 16 citations) hasn't been applied to coreference resolution
- **Token-Level Approach**: Direct similarity between contextual token embeddings vs. traditional span-based methods
- **Addresses Hard Cases**: Specifically targets multi-entity ambiguity scenarios that existing systems struggle with

### Research Questions
1. How well does contextual token embedding similarity correlate with coreference relationships?
2. In which scenarios does this approach outperform state-of-the-art coref systems?
3. Can this be combined with traditional coref for a hybrid system?
4. How does performance scale with context length and entity complexity?
5. What are the computational trade-offs vs. dedicated coref models?

## Experimental Design (When Ready)

## Implementation Notes

### Required Components

- **Computational Overhead**: Long-context models are more expensive than traditional coref
- **Error Propagation**: Mistakes in pronoun/entity detection affect downstream resolution
