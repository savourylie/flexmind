# Late Chunking for Pronoun Resolution

**Status**: Research Idea - Potential Publication  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Priority**: Medium-High (Novel application of recent technique)

## Problem Statement

Traditional coreference resolution systems struggle with complex multi-entity scenarios where multiple pronouns refer to different entities in close proximity. Classic example:

> "When Alice met Beth at the café, she told her that she had won the lottery."

Which "she" refers to Alice? Which to Beth? Existing neural coref systems often fail here due to ambiguous syntactic patterns and limited contextual understanding.

## Proposed Solution

Use **late chunking** with long-context embedding models to resolve pronoun coreference through contextual token embeddings, using a three-stage hybrid approach.

### Refined Technical Workflow

**Stage 1: Traditional Coreference (Small Chunks)**
- Use CorefSafeChunker with 350-600 token windows for optimal coref performance
- Run existing coref systems to identify entities and pronouns
- Create baseline entity clusters with confidence scores

**Stage 2: Late Chunking Enhancement (Large Windows)** 
- Create large overlapping windows (2K-8K tokens) with 50-75% overlap
- Ensure each large window contains complete entity clusters from Stage 1
- Apply late chunking with long-context embedding models (e.g., jina-embeddings-v2-base-en)
- Extract contextual token embeddings only for coref-identified entities and pronouns
- Use cosine similarity between pronoun embeddings and entity embeddings within coref-identified candidates

**Stage 3: Entity Canonicalization**
- Apply HDBSCAN clustering to group semantically similar entities (handles aliases and variations)
- Use cluster cohesion as confidence measure
- Fall back to original coref clusters when confidence is low

### Key Design Principles

- **Risk Management**: Worst case = baseline coref performance, best case = significant improvement
- **Constrained Search**: Only compute similarities between coref-identified candidates (reduces complexity)
- **Error Diagnosis**: Low cluster cohesion indicates potential chunking/method issues
- **Incremental Validation**: Each stage can be tested and validated independently

### Why This Could Work

- **Rich Context**: Each token embedding incorporates information from the entire passage
- **Semantic Role Awareness**: Pronouns in different semantic roles (agent vs. patient) should embed differently
- **Entity Specificity**: Entity embeddings reflect their discourse role, not just generic name representations
- **Direct Matching**: Simple similarity computation vs. complex span-based neural architectures

## Novelty & Research Value

### What's New
- **First Application**: Late chunking (2023, 16 citations) hasn't been applied to coreference resolution
- **Token-Level Approach**: Direct similarity between contextual token embeddings vs. traditional span-based methods
- **Addresses Hard Cases**: Specifically targets multi-entity ambiguity scenarios that existing systems struggle with

### Research Questions
1. How well does contextual token embedding similarity correlate with coreference relationships?
2. In which scenarios does this approach outperform state-of-the-art coref systems?
3. Can this be combined with traditional coref for a hybrid system?
4. How does performance scale with context length and entity complexity?
5. What are the computational trade-offs vs. dedicated coref models?

## Experimental Design (When Ready)

## Implementation Notes

### Required Components
- CorefSafeChunker integration for Stage 1 processing

- Large overlapping window generator for Stage 2
- Pronoun/entity detection pipeline  
- Token-level embedding extraction
- Similarity computation and thresholding
- HDBSCAN clustering with cohesion analysis
- Evaluation framework

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

- **~~Threshold Setting~~**: ✓ **SOLVED** - Using coref-identified candidates eliminates threshold setting complexity
- **~~Multiple Candidates~~**: ✓ **SOLVED** - HDBSCAN clustering with cohesion confidence handles ambiguous cases; fallback to coref when needed
- **~~Chunk Size Tension~~**: ✓ **SOLVED** - Two-pass strategy: small chunks (350-600 tokens) for coref, large overlapping windows (2K-8K tokens) for late chunking
- **Computational Overhead**: Long-context models are more expensive than traditional coref, but constrained search space mitigates this
- **Error Propagation**: Mistakes in coref entity detection will propagate, but system degrades gracefully to baseline performance
- **~~Long-Distance Dependencies~~**: ✓ **SOLVED** - Long-context models (8K tokens) exceed coref capabilities; coref-safe chunking ensures coverage

## Key Discussion Takeaways

### Why HDBSCAN for Clustering?
- **Unknown cluster count**: We don't know how many distinct entities exist in advance
- **Non-spherical clusters**: Entity relationships are not necessarily spherical in embedding space  
- **Noise handling**: HDBSCAN can identify outliers/noise points effectively
- **Computational cost acceptable**: For research context, accuracy is more important than speed

### Risk Management Strategy
- **"Plan B for Coref"**: Late chunking is enhancement, not replacement - system can't perform worse than baseline
- **Incremental validation**: Each stage can be tested independently with benchmark datasets
- **Graceful degradation**: When embedding methods fail, system falls back to original coref performance

### Confidence Mechanism
- **Cluster cohesion as diagnostic**: Low cohesion indicates potential issues with chunking/embeddings rather than inherent ambiguity
- **Principled fallback**: Clear decision criteria for when to trust embedding-based vs. coref-based clustering
- **Error signal**: Cohesion serves dual purpose as confidence measure and debugging tool

### Research Advantages
- **Methodologically sound**: Step-by-step approach makes research more rigorous and publishable
- **Clear baselines**: Coref performance provides solid foundation for measuring improvements
- **Adaptive potential**: Different strategies could be used for different text types (dialogue vs. narrative vs. technical)

## Dataset Strategy & Evaluation Plan

### Primary Focus: GAP Dataset
GAP is the ideal primary benchmark because:
- **Direct relevance**: Specifically designed for ambiguous pronoun resolution
- **Scale**: 8,908 labeled pairs provide robust statistical evaluation  
- **Practical scenarios**: Wikipedia text represents real-world complexity
- **Established baseline**: Existing results for comparison

### Staged Evaluation Approach
1. **OntoNotes/CoNLL-2012**: Establish baseline performance against SOTA
2. **GAP**: Demonstrate improvement on target problem (ambiguous multi-entity pronouns)
3. **WinoBias + WinoPron**: Test edge cases and bias handling
4. **Custom scenarios**: Validate on "Alice/Beth café" style examples

### Expected Performance Patterns
- **Standard cases**: Match or slightly improve over baseline coref
- **Multi-entity ambiguity**: Significant improvement over existing systems
- **Edge cases**: Robust handling with graceful degradation to coref baseline

## Notes & Ideas

- Could this extend beyond pronouns to other anaphoric expressions?
- What about cross-lingual applications?
- Integration with downstream tasks (QA, summarization)?
- Real-world applications in document processing?
- Each pipeline stage could potentially be a separate paper contribution
- GAP dataset success could be the key differentiator for publication

## Two-Pass Architecture Details

### Implementation Strategy
```python
class HybridCorefChunker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.coref_chunker = CorefSafeChunker(target_size=350, max_size=600)
        self.late_chunk_size = 4096  # Large windows for rich context
        self.overlap_ratio = 0.6     # 60% overlap between large windows
        
    def process(self, text):
        # Pass 1: Traditional coref on small chunks
        small_chunks = self.coref_chunker.chunk(text)
        coref_results = self.run_coref(small_chunks)
        
        # Pass 2: Large context windows for embeddings
        large_windows = self.create_overlapping_windows(text, self.late_chunk_size)
        embeddings = self.extract_entity_embeddings(large_windows, coref_results)
        
        # Pass 3: Enhance coref with embedding similarity
        return self.combine_coref_and_embeddings(coref_results, embeddings)
```

### Computational Efficiency Benefits
- **Targeted Processing**: Large context models only process identified entities, not all text
- **Constrained Search**: Similarity computation only between coref candidates
- **Graceful Fallback**: System maintains baseline performance when enhancement fails
- **Leveraged Strengths**: Each component operates in its optimal context window size
